# Mita Cursor Linux version
Mita Cursor recoded by sreetx


we are not here to pirate other people's work. we only recode the cursor file so that it can be used on Debian-derived Linux OS such as Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Linux Lite, etc.
Initially this cursor was only available for Windows and Mac natively. So we recoded it.

# Installation

Follow and enter these commands one by one in the terminal!

    git clone https://github.com/Sreetx/Mita-Cursor-linux_version.git

To see the contents of the file that was cloned earlier:

    ls

Continue the previous one:

    cd 'Mita Cursor linux_version'
    sudo mv 'Mita Cursor' /usr/share/icons/

Install and apply the icon from each DE setting

KDE Plasma:

    System Settings > Appearance > Cursor > (Find and select Mita Cursors)

GNOME:

    Tweaks > Appearance > Cursors > (Find and Select Mita Cursors)
    Yeah it's the same >.<

Reboot your system to apply it:
